> **ALPHA SOFTWARE — NOT PRODUCTION READY**
> This project is in early alpha. Expect breaking changes, missing features, and rough edges. Use at your own risk.

**AuricIDE** is a high-performance, AI-native Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically engineered for Markdown, natural language processing, and seamless collaboration with AI agents. It bridges the gap between structured documentation and agentic workflows, providing a lightweight, futuristic environment for modern developers and technical writers.

> **Auric** (adj.): Derived from gold (aurum). An IDE for the "Golden Age" of AI-driven development.

## 🌟 Vision & Philosophy

AuricIDE is built on the premise that **natural language is the new source code**. As we move towards agentic workflows where we communicate intent to AI, our primary "IDE" should be optimized for language, not just syntax.

- **Agent-First:** Not just a chat window, but a command center for spawning and managing autonomous agents (like openCode).
- **Skim-Optimized:** Features NLP-aware highlighting (e.g., highlighting nouns/entities) to help humans grasp the "meaning" of long texts at a glance.
- **Visual & Structural:** Bridges the gap between linear Markdown and non-linear process flows with a built-in visual canvas.
- **Ultra-Lightweight:** Built with Tauri and Rust for a footprint that rivals VS Code while providing native power.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Native Editing

- **NLP Syntax Highlighting:** Intelligent highlighting of grammatical structures (nouns, verbs, entities) to accelerate information retrieval.
- **Context-Aware Agents:** Spawn AI sub-tasks directly from highlighted text. Monitor agent progress via real-time embedded terminals.
- **Markdown Refactoring:** Rename headings, update references, and reorganize content with the same precision as a Java or Rust IDE.
- **ASCII Art Intelligence:** Automatic detection and AI-assisted repair of ASCII diagrams and mockups.

### 🎨 Visual & Diagramming

- **Live Mermaid Integration:** Real-time preview and interactive editing of Mermaid.js diagrams directly within the Markdown flow.
- **Visual Process Canvas:** A node-based editor (`@xyflow/react`) that maps bi-directionally to structured Markdown files—ideal for designing AI workflows.
- **WikiLink Ecosystem:** Full support for `[[WikiLinks]]` with completion, hover previews, and broken link detection.

### 📋 Requirements Management

- **Application Invariants:** Define long-lived invariants (functional & non-functional) that your project must continuously satisfy — unlike tickets, requirements are never "done". Link test cases to prove invariants hold, track verification freshness, and scope requirements to specific code paths (`appliesTo`).
- **Lifecycle Tracking:** Each requirement moves through `draft → active → implemented → verified → deprecated`, with `lastVerifiedAt` timestamps showing when the invariant was last proven. Stale requirements (>30 days unverified) are visually flagged.
- **Test Linkage:** Connect requirements to test cases that prove them. The join table cascades on delete and is exposed via MCP tools for agentic verification workflows.
- **Category & Priority Filtering:** Organize requirements by category (e.g. `auth`, `perf`) with automatic ID generation (`REQ-AUTH-01`) and filter by priority, status, or verification freshness (Fresh / Stale / Unverified).
- **MCP-Integrated:** AI agents can list, create, update, verify, link/unlink test cases, and query requirements through 10 built-in MCP tools.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Attach Markdown checklists to each requirement that define what "fulfilled" means — bridging the gap between spec and test.

### 🛠️ Developer-Grade Tooling

- **Integrated Git Control:** File explorer status indicators (A/M/D), gutter markers for line-level changes, and a dedicated source control panel.
- **Professional Terminal:** Full PTY sessions powered by Rust's `portable-pty` and `xterm.js`, allowing for seamless CLI interaction.
- **Slash Commands:** Notion-style `/commands` for rapid inserting of templates, diagrams, and agent prompts.
- **Linter & Processor:** Real-time Markdown linting using `remark` and `unified` to ensure consistent formatting and valid links.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **pnpm** >= 8
- **Rust** >= 1.77 (for building the Tauri backend)
- [Tauri Dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS.

### Installation & Development

The easiest way to get started is using the provided development scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PlasmaLampe/AuricIDE.git
cd AuricIDE

# Check your environment and start the development server
./run_dev.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run the steps manually:

```bash
# Verify your environment
./check_env.sh

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Launch in Development Mode (Full Desktop App)
pnpm tauri:dev

# Run Web-only Preview (Limited native features)
pnpm dev
```

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

AuricIDE is built with a focus on reliability and performance.

```bash
pnpm check:all        # Runs Linting, Formatting, Rust/TS Tests, and Clippy
pnpm test             # Run Vitest suite (Frontend)
pnpm tauri:test       # Run Cargo tests (Backend)
pnpm test:e2e         # Run Playwright end-to-end tests
```
